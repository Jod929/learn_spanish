# Functional Spanish

I am making this website so I can become better at the Spanish Lanuage. I have used a lot of online resources and I have noticed that there is a lot of added fluff, unneccessary complexity, and overpriced sevices.

My mission is to provide users with a single resource for all conjugations, words, and ways of thinking needed to functionally speak the spanish language in the quickest time possible. This can be accomplished becuase we can break down the language into smaller logical parts, and only memorize the things we need to get by, and pick up the others along the way.

One thing I have noticed is that in learning a new language, many resources will use words like 'definite article' or 'third person pronoun' and while theses are helpful when really getting down to the meat of language, this is not something that helps us learn to speak. To display this, an example of 'definite artile' is 'the' and an example of a 'third person pronoun' is 'it'.

We dont need to know the labels of these, we just need to know how and where to use them.

Looking at the most commonly used words in the english language (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English),
we can see that majority of these words are ones like: 'it', 'be', 'and', 'that'. If we can learn these words and how use them along with common verbs and their conjugations, we can basically say anything we want. This can be learned much quicker than other ways, and this is the method of Functional Spanish.
